# simonitto-vipAge-progetto
The project work on data mining had the task of working on a dataset taken at the following [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imoore/age-dataset).

The dataset shows thousands of VIPs, describing for each: Name, Short description, Gender, Country, Occupation, Birth year, Death year, Manner of death, Age of death.

Since the dataset is too big to work with, we reduced its size and did a pre-processing job.
In the pre-processing work we have grouped:
* the Country by continents
* the Occupations
* the Manner of death

Then we trasformed categorical and ordinal features into numeric features to subsequently do the clustering.
